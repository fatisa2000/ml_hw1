## About iPython Notebooks ##

iPython Notebooks are interactive coding environments embedded in a webpage. You will be using iPython notebooks in this class. You only need to write code between the ### START CODE HERE ### and ### END CODE HERE ### comments. After writing your code, you can run the cell by either pressing "SHIFT"+"ENTER" or by clicking on "Run Cell" (denoted by a play symbol) in the upper bar of the notebook. 

**Exercise**: Set test to `"Hello World"` in the cell below to print "Hello World" and run the two cells below.
"""

### START CODE HERE ###
test ="hello world" 
print(test)
### END CODE HERE ###

"""<font color='blue'>
**What you need to remember**:
- Run your cells using SHIFT+ENTER (or "Run cell")
- Write code in the designated areas using Python 3 only
- Do not modify the code outside of the designated areas
